Problem 1.9 - String Rotation
Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one world is a substring of another.
Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring.

Example Input - "waterbottle", "erbottlewat"

Brainstorm - 
Check length. It would need to be equal to be correct.

Solution - 
Find the rotation point. If you put the rotated strings together the whoel string will be included within the two rotated stirngs.

erbottlewaterbottlewat, waterbottle
is s2s2, s1
