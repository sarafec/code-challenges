Problem 1.7 - Rotate Matrix
Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method  to reoteate the image by 90 degress. 
Follow-up: can you do this in place?

Brainstorm - 
Swap indexes in place, starting from the outermost layer and working our way inwards.
for i = 0 to n
	temp = top[i]
	top[i] = left[i]
	left[i] = bottom[i]
	bottom[i] = right[i]
	right[i] = temp

Performance - O(n^2) runnign time
