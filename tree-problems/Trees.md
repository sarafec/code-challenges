1. Given a binary search tree, create a linked list of all the node at each length. 
  
2. Convert a binary search tree into a doubly linked list.
  
3. Determine if a binary tree is balanced.
  
4. Given a sorted array, create a binary search tree with minimal height.
  
5. Implement a function that checks if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
  
6. Write an algorithm to find the next node (in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. Assume that each node has a link to its parent. 
  
7. Find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Do not store additoinal nodes in a data structure.
  
8. Given two very large binary trees, T1 has millions of nodes and T2 has hundres of nodes, determine if T2 is a subtree of T1. 
A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. If you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
  
9. Given a binary tree in which each node contains a value, print all paths which sum to a given value. Be aware taht a path can start or end anywhere in the tree.
