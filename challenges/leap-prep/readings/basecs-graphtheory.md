### BaseCS: A Gentle Introduction to Graph Theory
* Trees are just a restricted type of graph. A tree will always be a graph, but not all graphs will be trees.
* One characterstic every graph must have - it must have at least one node.
* There are two types of graphs that are commonly used in graph theory problems - directed graphs and undirected graphs.
* Graphs can have two types of edges - a edge that has a direction or flow.
* In a directed edge, two nodes are connected in a very specific way. In a directed edge, we can only travel from the origin to the destination and never the other way around.
* In an undirected edge, the path we can travel goes both ways. That means the path between two nodes is bidirectional.
* In mathematics, graphs are a way to formally represent a network, which is basically just a collection of objects that are all interconnected.
* In mathematics, graphs are defined as ordered pairs with two parts - vertices + edges. Or G = (V, E).
* Metaphors for graphs - you can think of twitter as a directed graph. Each edge represents a one-way relationship.
