#### BaseCS: Leaf It Up To Binary Trees
* BSTs are a tree data structure that adheres to a set of very specific rules.
* Trees are recursive data structures, which means that a single tree is made up of many others.
* The child node of a tree structure could also very welll be the parent node to many other child nodes. Which makes it the rood node of a mini subtree of a larger tree structure.
* In order for a BSt to be searchable, all of the nodes ot the left of the root node must be less than the value of the root node. And all vaues on the right of the root node must be greater than the root node.
* You can perform binary searches on a binary search tree.
* Binary search is an algorithm that simplifies and speeds up searching through a sorted collection by dividing the search set into two groups and comparing an element to one that is larger or smaller than the one you're looking for.
