Problem 1.5 - One Away
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings - insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character.
Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away. 

Brainstorm - 
Lengths must be equal or plus/minus one to be true.
Order matters, so you cannot utilize an ascii mapp to check for differences.

Solution - 
Check lengths, compare two strings and seeing if one edit will make the two strings equal
The oneEditReplace method has a foundDifference boolean flag.
The oneEditInsert method takes both strings and compares the characters in the string and increments the index
