### BaseCS: KÃ¶nigsberg: Seven Small Bridges, One Giant Graph Problem
* Two vertices in a graph are adjacent if they share a common edge (an edge joins the vertices).
* The degree of a vertix is the total number of vertices that are adjacent to the vertex. Or how many neighbors vertices does this node have?
* A path in a grpah means the way that you can get from one vertex (the origin) to another (the destination).
* A path P is defined as an ordered list of directed edges. For example, P = ((A,B), (B,C), (C,A)).
* A simple path is a unique type of path that is more constricted - in a simple path, no nodes or edges can be repeated while traversing the graph.
* A cycle is a simple path that must end our traversal at the same node that we started off at.
* A Eulerian path is a path wherein we only visit each edge in the graph once. While a Eulerian circuit is a Eulerian path that is a cycle - we only visit every edge once, and we end on the exact same node that we started off on.
